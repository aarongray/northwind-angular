northwind-angular
=================

This simple app shows the differences between a basic implementation of a handful of Angular libraries. It currently compares:

* Angular's [ngResource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource) vs. [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular)

* Angular's [ngRoute](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute) vs. [Angular-UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

The master branch uses vanilla Angular, and there are other branches named for the libraries they represent.

This repo is a front end designed to be paired with [northwind-rails](https://github.com/aarongray/northwind-rails).

Run the app using `grunt server`.
