northwind-angular
=================

This simple app demonstrates the basic differences between using vanilla Angular's [ngResource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource) and [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular). It also shows the differences between and vanilla Angular's [ngRoute](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute) and [Angular-UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router). The master branch uses vanilla Angular, and there are other branches for the other library implementations.

This repo is a front end designed to be paired with [northwind-rails](https://github.com/aarongray/northwind-rails).

Run the app using `grunt server`.
